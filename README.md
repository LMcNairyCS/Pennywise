 Pennywise – Manual Budget Tracker

 Concept

Pennywise is a personal finance app focused on manual budgeting and complete user control. Instead of linking to external bank accounts, Pennywise lets users track paychecks, log expenses, and manage spending across customizable categories—all from a clean, spreadsheet-inspired interface.

The app is designed to be simple, transparent, and practical. It removes distractions and automation in favor of clarity and hands-on financial awareness. Every dollar is accounted for manually, helping users stay intentional with their money.

This project is built as part of a developer portfolio and is under active development. All progress is documented and available within the repository.
